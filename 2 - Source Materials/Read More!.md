Basically Experience MOREEE!!, Like an artist that steals or "remix" from other artist. That extends to your thoughts, 

if you read a book 1984 by George Orwell **We live in a society**, 

"You should read more books so you have more ideas to express yourself" - Youtube guy

also heres a good book recomendation "steal like an artist" , he said
"You are in fact a mashup of whats you choose to let into your life, you are the sum of your influences"

"Your job is to collect a good idea"
