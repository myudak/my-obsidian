I fucking love Disco Elysium & think it’s a masterpiece. That said I can totally understand why it’s not for everyone.

Its gameplay is reading, making choices & passing or failing skill checks. It plays more like a book that you are having a hand in writing who the protagonist is & where the story goes. So anyone that doesn’t consider that gameplay/doesn’t consider that good gameplay, is probably already gonna hate it before they start the game.

One of my favorite moments in the game was a skill check that I only had a 30% chance of passing. The writing is entirely subjective whether you enjoy it or not. You pick from RPG paths that are entirely unique to the game, so you don’t really know where most of them will go or what skills you will need to do what in the game. Some paths have entirely different flavors, so someone may choose one that they end up hating whereas they may have loved it if they chose a different one. There are lots of attempts at weird kinds of humor in the game & unique styles of humor never work for everyone. LOL

There are lots of reasons to both love & hate the game. Every game is not for everyone. Subjectivity is amazing, as what can be trash to one person can be a masterpiece to another.

IS IT WORTH SACRIFICING YOUR DIGNITY, HEALTH, AND FRIENDSHIP  JUST TO AVOID THE HARDSHIP OF LIFE

What is communism about? It's about failure, mostly. -Disco Elysium

It's a politically loaded game written by communists that absolutely roasts multiple political ideologies. As someone who is politically a centrist, I was thoroughly, almost malevolently, scorched by Disco Elysium.

It was hilarious, I love the game.

Anyways the only downside to Disco Elysium discussions, imo, is you'll inevitably run into someone who is evangelically communist, which is annoying
