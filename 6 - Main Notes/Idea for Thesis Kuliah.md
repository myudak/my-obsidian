# Idea for Thesis Kuliah

Ide skripsi kuliah
rewrite something into rust?
1. In your shoes, I would pick an existing bit of software and re-write some/all of it in Rust. The benefit here is you have a reference point you can compare your implementation to for the sake of your thesis. For example, the entire [ping](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/ping.c) command is about 1,200 lines of C. Writing your own version would be a great way to explore command line utilities, networking, and how to interface with the system. Otherwise, just anything you find personally interesting. Enthusiasm is your greatest barrier to overcome. Even if you "fail" to write your full piece of software, a good thesis can discuss _why_ you failed and what you learned.
